> Kestrel is the web server used in the example, it's a new cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core that's included in new project templates by default. Kestrel is fine to use on it's own for internal applications and development, but for public facing websites and applications it should sit behind a more mature reverse proxy server (IIS, Apache, Nginx etc) that will receive HTTP requests from the internet and forward them to Kestrel after initial handling and security checks.

**This project is my take on the merging of Jason Watmore's https://github.com/cornflourblue/aspnet-core-3-role-based-authorization-api and https://github.com/cornflourblue/aspnet-core-3-registration-login-api repos as a way to combine both functionality with the data I would be dealing with.
